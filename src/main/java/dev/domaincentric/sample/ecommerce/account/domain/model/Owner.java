 * account: it is captured once at registration and no operation replaces it. The only detail that
 * may be corrected later is the date of birth, via {@link #withDateOfBirth(LocalDate)} — which
 * carries both names over unchanged, so the immutability of the name is a property of the type
 * rather than a rule a caller has to remember.
 *
 * <p>Names are trimmed but never otherwise normalized: capitalization, particles and spelling of a
 * person's own name are not the account's to correct.
